# Problem :
# Query bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013 for the name and gender of the babies in this dataset, and then list the top 10 names in descending order.
# My Take
select count(distinct(name)) as d_name,name,gender from bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013
group by name,gender
order by d_name desc
limit 10

# Soln Provided
SELECT
  name, gender,
  SUM(number) AS total
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
GROUP BY
  name, gender
ORDER BY
  total DESC
LIMIT
  10
